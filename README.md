## Synopsis 
This application is designed to be an all in one day planner that provides weather information as well as a soundtrack to compliment your day. With this application you can easily organize your daily activities in an easy to read format while being provided with a soundtrack tailored to the current weather conditions. The user is also given the option to choose a different soundtrack if they chose to do so.

## Difficulties
No project comes without its own set of difficulties and issues. There were a few things we had issues with along the way. It took us some time to be sure we stepped on each others toes as little as possible. With this being the first time doing a project in a group and having multiple people push their changes it is easy to run into merge conflicts and other issues. We had to learn how to be sure that everything we were pushing wasn't going to ruin what someone else was already working on. 

## Future Implementations
A future feature that we would want to implement is instead of hard coding in Charlotte as the location, we want to use geolocation to pull the coordinates and grab the user location based on that so it would reflect the weather near to where they are.
